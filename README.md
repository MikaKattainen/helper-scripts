# Helper Scripts

This repository contains a few scripts that I use to help speed things along. Especially when working with a project that constsist multiple repositories.

NOTE: The scripts are provided as is and they may or may not work. Use at your own discretion.
NOTE: All the scripts were made for MacOS. They could in theory work on Linux as well but they have not been tested.

## Scripts list
- docker-volume-containers.sh: can be used for finding docker volumes that are no longer in use
- find-critical-vulnerabilities.sh: find vulnerabilities in nodejs projects (yarn or npm only at the moment)
- find-repos-with-unstaged-changes.sh: find repositories where there are unstaged changes
- git-pull-all.sh: do a `git pull` for all git projects in the folder

## How to use

1. Read the scripts and make sure you understand what they do before running them
2. Save the script on your machine
3. Run the script with `sh path/to/script.sh`
